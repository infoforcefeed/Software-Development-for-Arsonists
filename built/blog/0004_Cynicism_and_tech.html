Yep. I've seen it.</p><p>For years I've wanted to start a tech community like they had in the good ol'
days. You know, just building shit. I've always wanted a place where I can
collaborate and share code, learn how to RE, and get shocked a few times by an
ad hoc bench power supply.</p><p>I feel like I almost have it, but organizing these people is a lot like herding
cats through a 20 foot wide door. Everyone pretends to care and then excuses
about being busy get played like a broken record.</p><p>You see, sometimes politics get involved, which is fine; I like politics, but
then people disagree on a level that shouldn't even exist. There should be
healthy discussion and debate.</p><p>Then people get lazy. "Want to have hacknight Saturday?" 50 hands go up and 3
show up.</p><p>I'm trying to build something great. I started infoforcefeed as a place to chat
about technology on freenode, but it soon turned into a coding heaven. Different
skills started joining the channel and everybody had things to share. The
channel is pushing 5 years old, which I never thought would happen.</p><p>I want it to continue in that direction, but I have a distaste for the recent
spats of "fuck the world"<q>I don't care</q>and overall, general laziness. I'm
guilty of it too. Very much so. But at the same time, I feel like I reach out
all the time with ideas and want to code something, but I get ignored.</p><p>So lets get our shit together, infoforcefeed and start building awesome open
source tools that break boundaries. Also, stop smoking so much fucking weed,
it's bad for you.</p><p>If you're interested in building things, come join us on
<a href=irc://irc.freenode.net/#infoforcefeed>IRC</a>.</p><p>Cool.</p><p></p></div><!--<div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'olegdbblog';(function() {var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);})();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href="http://disqus.com" class="dsq-brlink">comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a>--></div>

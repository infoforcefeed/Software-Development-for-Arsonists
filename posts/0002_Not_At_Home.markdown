Not at home syndrome is a condition effecting hundreds of thousands or even
millions of Americans. It's the condition of working in the software or computer
engineering industry as a 9 to 5er.

Thou shalt only write code while at work. Not at home. Computers don't exist
when I get home. I only have a work computer.

Together, we can find a cure to this disease. I want you to attempt the 10,000
commit challenge.

What is the 10,000 commit challenge you ask? Github provides some nice stats on
your profile page under the "Contributions" tab. See my
[profile](https://github.com/kyleterry). Under that tab is "Year of
contributions"; this is your goal. That sweet sweet 10k.

Don't use Github you say? That's okay; you're smart. You can count your commits
somehow.
